I am a 22-year-old passionate Python programmer and web developer, with a strong foundation in IT. I completed my 10th grade from Sterling School, Nerul, with 61%, and then pursued a Diploma in Information Technology from B.V.I.T. Belapur, where I graduated with First Class Distinction (89%) in 2021.

After completing my diploma, I dedicated myself to enhancing my web development skills by taking an in-depth online course through Udemy. During this period, I faced significant health challenges that affected my progress for almost two years, but I remained determined. I ultimately completed my web development course and later took a Python Pro course to further refine my skills and knowledge.

Along the way, I also explored UI/UX design by learning Figma, broadening my perspective on creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. As a result, I now have a strong grasp of both back-end and front-end development, along with an understanding of user interface design principles.

I am actively seeking new opportunities where I can apply my skills in Python programming, web development, and UI/UX design, while continuing to learn and grow in a dynamic, challenging environment.
